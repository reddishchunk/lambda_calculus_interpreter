The Lambda Calculus Interpreter is designed as an interpreter to interpret lambda calculus expressions. This source code is for the typed lambda calculus evaluator.

The LCI is designed to run source code directly without compilation or intermediate bytecode. Design considerations for the LCI should emphasize readability of code, with optimizations being explicit in detail and weighted against maintainability of code. Comments should be used whenever code blocks are self explanatory and at the top of files to demonstrate implementation details. The project is to be made in C99, following K&R conventions and style. Data should be kept within nearest scope whenever possible.

Components of this project include:
	- Buffer to handle loading file into memory
	- Lexer to convert buffer into tokens
	- Parser to construct AST tree out of tokens
	- Evaluation of AST tree
	Notes:
	* Between the lexer and the parser, processing functionality should be delegated to 
	  the lexer when possible.
	* Default configurations and outside dependencies should be kept to a minimum. 
          The C standard library should be used extensively, reserving outside libraries only
          in cases that are strictly necessary.
	* Typed lambda calculus should be handled in a way that mirrors its evaluation by hand.
	* The LCI does not implement a garbage collector. Freeing of pointers must be done explicitly.
